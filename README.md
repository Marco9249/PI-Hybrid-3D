## 🚀 About The Project

This project is not just a visualization; it's an immersive journey into the architecture of a state-of-the-art AI model. Built with **Three.js** and **Vanilla JavaScript**, it transforms complex neural network operations into a tangible, interactive 3D experience.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Physics-Informed Core:** visualizing the 15-vector physics engine.
- **Deep Learning Layers:** Interactive exploration of CNN, LSTM, and Dense layers.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Dynamic sun positioning and environmental effects.
- **Cinematic Aesthetics:** High-fidelity visuals with bloom, dynamic lighting, and smooth animations.
