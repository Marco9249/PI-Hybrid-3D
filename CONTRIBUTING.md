# 🤝 Contributing to PI-Hybrid 3D Viz

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new physics-informed features

## ⚡ Our Development Process

## 📐 Code Guidelines

- **No Build Tools:** We generally use Vanilla JS to keep it lightweight.
- **Three.js:** Ensure all 3D assets are properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks.
- **Physics First:** Any AI visualization should be grounded in the underlying physics equations.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
